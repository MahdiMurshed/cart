# Docker Compose File Explanation

This is a `docker-compose.yml` file, which is used to define and run multi-container Docker applications. It uses YAML syntax, and it allows you to configure your application's services, networks, and volumes in a single file.

Here's a breakdown of the file:

- **version: "3.8"**: This specifies the version of Docker Compose to use. The version impacts the available features and syntax. Can be any arbitrary string.

- **services**: This section defines the services (containers) that make up your application. In this case, there's a single service named `db`.

  - **db**: This is the name of the service.

  - **image: mysql:8**: This specifies the Docker image to use for this service. Here, it's using version 8 of the MySQL image.

  - **restart: always**: This tells Docker to always restart the container if it stops. If it's manually stopped, it won't be restarted.

  - **environment**: This section allows you to set environment variables in the container. Here, it's setting variables for the MySQL database name, user, password, root password, TCP port, and root host.

  - **ports**: This maps the container's ports to the host. Here, it's mapping the container's port 3309 to the host's port 3309.

  - **expose**: This exposes ports without publishing them to the host machine. Here, it's exposing port 3309.
